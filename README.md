Development of a Pushdown Automata (PDA) Simulator using C++
<br>
The Development of Pushdown Automaton (PDA) Simulator project aims to create a
software tool that allows users to simulate the behavior of Pushdown Automata. This
simulator will provide an interactive environment for users to input PDAs, test them with
various input strings, and visualize their transitions, aiding in the understanding and
exploration of context-free languages and automata theory.
